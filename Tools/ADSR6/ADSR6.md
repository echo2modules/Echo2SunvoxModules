# ADSR6
Simple ADSR generator, with exponential envelope support.
Use it with Sound2Ctl and FilterPro or other module. *(There are some restrictions because of clicks. Try to use it with controllers which have more than 8000 value limit)*

You can use it as amplitude ADSR, just connect it to amplitude Modulator module.
