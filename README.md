# Echo2SunvoxModules

This repository will house my Sunvox modules, which I would like to share with the Sunvox Community.
Modules will be divided into categories, each of which will be assigned a separate folder.
For each module, I will try to add a small explanation, for which each controller is responsible and how they are arranged from the inside.
Enjoy the modules! If you have suggestions for improvement and optimization - some modules do really strain SunVox, please share your suggestions.
It would be nice if you mention that you've used these modules and will apply a link to this repository.

**Important note: SunVox version must be v1.9.2 or higher.**
